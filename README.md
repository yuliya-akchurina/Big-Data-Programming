## Big Data Programming Projects

### Lab 1 - MapReduce on Hadoop with Python.

Lab 1 consists of the two parts. It is using an IP log report. Part 1 finds the top 3 IP addresses for each hour. Part 2 takes user input for the value of the hour and provides the top 3 IP addresses for the specified hour. 


### Project 1 - MapReduce on Hadoop with Python.

Project 1 is utilizing MapReduce framework running on Hadoop Cluster hosted in Google Cloud to answer questions about the two different datasets. The code is written in Python and Bash script. The two datasets as well as links to the data sources are included in the project folders and in the project report. 
The project consists of two parts. Part 1 uses NY Parking Violations dataset from 2021 fiscal year. 
Part 2 uses NBA Shot Logs dataset. Question 2 in Part 2 develops MapReduce based K-Means classifier to partition data into four clusters. 
Each part of the project has a readme file providing more details about the set up. 


### Lab 2 - Spark on Hadoop with PySpark.

Lab 2 is using the datasets from Project 1. It is answering some of the questions from Project 1 by utilizing PySpark instead of MapReduce framework. 


### Project 2 - Spark on Hadoop with PySpark.

Project 2 is utilizing Spark framework that is set up on top of Hadoop Cluster hosted in Google Cloud. The code is written in PySpark and Bash script.
There are three datasets that are analyzed: Toxic Comment Classification, Framingham Heart dataset, Census Income Data. The datasets and data sources are listed in the project folders and the report. 
Project 2 consists of four parts. Part 1 performs Toxic Comment Classification using Logistic Regression Classification model. 
Part 2 is Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression model. 
Part 3 is predicting income for Census Income Data using Logistic Regression Classifier model. 
Part 4 is predicting income for  Census Income Data using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers.
Each part of the project has a readme file providing more details about the set up.
